  You are a cyber-security analyst. Following is text extracted from a security blog (BLOG_TEXT).
  IOC's are indicators of compromise. They are traces that can serve as an evidence that a certain malware will leave.
  For example, if the command and control server of a certain malware is reached with the domain c2server.evil than this domain is an IOC to this malware.
  
  Read the blog, and extract all the IOC's of type {ioc_type} from the blog.
  You should extract all IOC's of type {ioc_type} only and return them as a valid JSON list (LIST_OF_IOCS).
  Do not include any additional information or context.
