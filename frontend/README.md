### Up and running options:
Assuming the app `.env` file is configured correctly, you can run the app using one of the following options:

#### Docker (Recommended)
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```
Once the app is up and running, you can access it at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)

### Local
For running the app locally, you'll need `node` and `npm` installed on your machine. We recommend using [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) for managing node versions.
```bash
cd frontend
nvm use
npm install
npm run build
```

Once the build is complete, you can run the app using the following command from the root directory:
```bash
cd ..
python -m uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```
One the app is up and running, you can access it at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)

### Development
For development purposes, you can run the app in development mode using the following command:

Start the backend server:
```bash
python -m uvicorn main:app --reload
```
and in a separate terminal, start the frontend development server:
```bash
cd frontend
nvm use
npm install
npm run dev
```

Once the app is up and running, you can access it at [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)
